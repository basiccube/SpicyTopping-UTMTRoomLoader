# Spicy Topping - UTMT Room Loader

This repository contains the code (or most of it at least) for the portion of the UTMT room export feature that handles loading and letting you actually play the rooms that get exported.  
The code here uses some stuff present in Spicy Topping, so if you'd like to use it in normal PT, you'll have to edit the code a little bit. It's mostly just debug stuff.  
Feel free to do whatever you want with it, I guess.

# rm_utmtroom

There are probably a few places where a room called "rm_utmtroom" is mentioned.  
This room is just an empty room with a "UTMTRoom" instance layer in it that has an instance of obj_utmtroom within it.
